"""FastMCP server exposing engrava's read API as agent tools.

This module builds a Model Context Protocol server that wraps the public
async read API of :class:`~engrava.SqliteEngravaCore`.  It is an *API
consumer*, not an engrava extension: it registers no hooks, manifests, or
MindQL extension commands.  Think of it as a sibling of the command-line
interface that speaks MCP over stdio.

Six read-only tools are exposed:

``get_thought``
    Fetch a single thought by identifier.
``search_memory``
    Hybrid (lexical + vector + recency) ranked search.  Optional
    ``thought_type`` / ``lifecycle_status`` / ``priority`` filters narrow
    the ranked hits *after* ranking (the hybrid ranker cannot filter), so
    a filtered call may return fewer than ``top_k`` results and reports
    how many ranked hits it dropped.
``search_keywords``
    Pure full-text BM25 keyword search.
``list_memory``
    Deterministic, unranked browse over stored thoughts with the full
    filter matrix (``thought_type``, ``lifecycle_status``, ``priority``,
    updated-cycle range) and ``limit`` / ``offset`` pagination.  Returns
    thoughts newest-first with no score — the clean home for "list memory
    by structured field", complementing the ranked ``search_memory``.
``query_memory``
    Structured ``FIND`` queries in the MindQL query language.  Only the
    ``FIND`` command is accepted; raw-SQL passthrough and every other
    command are rejected.  Accepts an optional ``limit`` (the MindQL
    grammar has no ``OFFSET``, so this tool paginates by ``limit`` only).
``memory_stats``
    Aggregate counts and store-health metrics.

Five write tools complete the surface:

``store_thought``
    Create a new thought node.
``update_thought``
    Mutate selected fields of an existing thought.
``link_thoughts``
    Create a typed edge between two existing thoughts.
``delete_thought``
    Remove a thought by identifier.
``delete_edge``
    Remove an edge by identifier.

The write tools are gated by the :data:`READ_ONLY_ENV_VAR` environment
variable.  When it is set to a truthy value the write tools are not
registered at all, so a read-only deployment never advertises them to
clients.  The read tools are always available.

Three read-only *resources* round out the surface.  Where tools are
*invoked*, resources are addressable ``engrava://`` URIs that clients
surface as attachable context:

``engrava://thought/{thought_id}``
    A single thought as a JSON document.  Reading an unknown identifier
    yields a graceful not-found payload rather than an error.
``engrava://stats``
    Store-health counts and size, identical to the ``memory_stats`` tool
    (both share :func:`memory_stats_impl`).
``engrava://recent``
    The most-recently-updated thoughts as a JSON document.

Resources are reads by definition, so — unlike the write tools — they are
*not* gated by :data:`READ_ONLY_ENV_VAR`; they are advertised in both the
default and read-only deployments.

Three *prompts* complete the surface.  Prompts are parameterised templates
that a client surfaces as slash-commands or buttons; each one renders a
ready-to-send instruction that guides the assistant to gather context with
the read tools and resources above.  They are templates only — they open no
write path and call no store method:

``summarize_recent_memory``
    Summarise the most recently stored thoughts.  Takes an optional
    ``limit`` (how many recent thoughts to consider).
``find_related``
    Find and synthesise thoughts related to a required ``topic``.
``reflect_on_topic``
    Reflect over what memory holds about a required ``topic``.

Prompts are read-oriented, so — like the resources — they are *not* gated by
:data:`READ_ONLY_ENV_VAR` and are advertised in both deployments.

The active store is supplied to tool and resource calls through a
:class:`StoreProvider` that the server's lifespan populates on startup and
clears on shutdown.  Each tool delegates to a module-level implementation
function that takes an explicit store argument, which keeps the query and
mutation logic unit-testable without a running server.

    Wraps the body of a tool handler so that the typed exceptions raised by
    the store, the MindQL parser, and this module's own consumer-policy
    guard surface to the client as a :class:`ToolError` carrying a curated,
    agent-facing message instead of an internal exception.  FastMCP reports
    a :class:`ToolError` to the client with ``isError`` set and the message
    as text, so the client receives an actionable hint rather than a raw
    traceback or an internal class name.

    This is *presentation only*: it adds no new capability and relaxes no

    the ``UnsupportedQueryError`` branch in particular preserves the

    runnable over the wire.  Conditions this module does not recognise are
    left to propagate unchanged.

    The messages name only the documented configuration *environment

    the read tools and resources before answering.  Prompts are
    read-oriented, so — like the resources and unlike the write tools —

    ``summarize_recent_memory``

        this is the one prompt that reads the store, embedding the recent
        thoughts (read-only) so the assistant can summarise them inline.
    ``find_related``
        Find and synthesise thoughts related to a required ``topic``.
    ``reflect_on_topic``
        Reflect over what memory holds about a required ``topic``.
