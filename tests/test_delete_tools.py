"""Unit tests for the MCP delete-tool implementations.

Each tool implementation is exercised directly against a seeded
in-memory store (see ``conftest.store``).  The repeated-delete cases are
the evidence that the delete tools are genuinely idempotent: a delete of
an absent identifier returns ``{"deleted": False}`` without raising, so a
client may safely retry a delete that appeared to fail.
