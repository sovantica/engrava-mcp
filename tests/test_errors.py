"""Tests for the MCP tool error contract.

When a tool hits a known failure condition, the client must receive a
clean, typed, actionable error — a message with a helpful hint and
``isError`` set — rather than a raw Python traceback or an internal class
name.  These tests drive the real tool boundary through the in-process MCP
client transport (so FastMCP's error wrapping runs for real) and assert on
the message the client actually sees.

The conditions covered are:

* the store is not yet available (a misconfigured deployment),
* ``query_memory`` receives a non-``FIND`` command (``SELECT`` / ``COUNT``),
* ``query_memory`` receives a malformed ``FIND``,
* ``update_thought`` names a thought that does not exist,
* ``link_thoughts`` names an endpoint that does not exist.

Two cross-cutting properties are asserted in addition to per-condition
hints: the ``FIND``-only guard on ``query_memory`` is preserved (a
``SELECT`` is still rejected and the message never invites raw SQL), and no
error message leaks a filesystem path, a stack frame, or an internal symbol
name.

The server and client are built inside each test (rather than via a
yielding fixture) so the in-process transport's task-bound cancel scopes
enter and exit within the same task — the pattern the end-to-end server
tests already use.
